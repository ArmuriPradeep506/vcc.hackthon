Create a complete front-end webpage using only HTML (no backend, no database, no external frameworks) for a system titled “Institutional Event Resource Management System.” The webpage must include a homepage, registration page, and login page with proper navigation links. When the user clicks “Register,” it should open a registration form page where users can select their role (Event Coordinator, HOD, Dean, Institutional Head, Admin/ITC) and enter details like name, department, email, password, and confirm password. When the user clicks “Login,” it should open a login form page with email, password, and role selection. After login (static HTML simulation using separate pages), redirect to a role-based dashboard page. Each role must have a separate dashboard layout: Event Coordinator dashboard should show event request form (schedule, participant count, venue type, resources), event status (pending/approved/rejected/running/completed), and resource release button; HOD dashboard should show event approval options (approve/reject/request modification) and department venue visibility; Dean dashboard should show cross-department events and priority adjustment options; Institutional Head dashboard should show full institutional overview and final approval controls; Admin/ITC dashboard should manage venues, equipment, facilities, and update availability. Include navigation bar, clean layout, section headings, buttons, forms, and footer. Use internal CSS styling inside the HTML file for a professional institutional look. Ensure proper role-based navigation links between pages. Do not use JavaScript, PHP, or any backend language. Only pure HTML with internal CSS styling.
